A Qt Gui generating program for controlling Osc-Parameter sets

The program parses a parameter description file and generates a hierarchical Gui from the OSC adresses.
It is most useful if the parameter description files are generated by your application, i.e. using the "dump" functionality of ArduPar

The whole thing is a bit of a hack, but it works quite well for me. If you like to contribute, let me know.

Try loading the "ExampleSet.txt" and take a look at it for more information.
